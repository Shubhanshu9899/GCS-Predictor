# GCS-Predictor

Stock prices, gold and currency exchange rates were very useful for the economic
and social growth of the country. Can we actually predict stock prices, global
currency indexes and global gold rates with machine learning? Investors make
educated guesses by analyzing data. They'll read the news, study the company
history, and analyze the economy of country, industry trends and other lots of data
points that go into making a prediction. The prevailing theories is these are totally
random and unpredictable but that raises the question why top firms like Morgan
Stanley and Citigroup hire quantitative analysts to build predictive models. We have
this idea of a trading floor being filled with adrenaline infuse men with loose ties
running around yelling something into a phone but these days they're more likely to
see rows of machine learning experts quietly sitting in front of computer screens.
